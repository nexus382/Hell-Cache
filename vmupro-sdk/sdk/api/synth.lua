-- Waveform type constants
vmupro.sound.kWaveSquare = 0     --- Square wave - classic 8-bit sound
vmupro.sound.kWaveTriangle = 1   --- Triangle wave - softer than square
vmupro.sound.kWaveSine = 2       --- Sine wave - pure tone
vmupro.sound.kWaveNoise = 3      --- White noise - useful for drums/effects
vmupro.sound.kWaveSawtooth = 4   --- Sawtooth wave - bright, buzzy sound
vmupro.sound.kWavePOPhase = 5    --- PO Phase modulation synthesis
vmupro.sound.kWavePODigital = 6  --- PO Digital synthesis
vmupro.sound.kWavePOVosim = 7    --- PO Vosim synthesis
