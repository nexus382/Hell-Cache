--- @class SequenceObject
--- @field id number Internal handle for the sequence

--- @class TrackObject
--- @field id number Internal handle for the track

--- @brief Load a MIDI file as a sequence
--- @param path string Path to MIDI file (relative to VMUPack root)
--- @return SequenceObject|nil Sequence object, or nil on error
--- @return string|nil Error message if failed
--- @usage local seq = vmupro.sound.sequence.new("assets/song.mid")
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.

--- @param seq SequenceObject Sequence to query
--- @return number Number of tracks in the MIDI file

--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.

--- @brief Get a track at a specific index
--- @param seq SequenceObject Sequence to query
--- @param index number Track index (1-based)
--- @return TrackObject|nil Track object, or nil if index out of range
--- @usage local track = vmupro.sound.sequence.getTrackAtIndex(seq, 1)
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
---       Actual implementation is provided by VMU Pro firmware at runtime.

--- @brief Assign an instrument to a MIDI track
--- @param seq SequenceObject Sequence to configure
--- @param trackIndex number Track index (1-based)
--- @param inst InstrumentObject Instrument to use for this track

--- @brief Set a callback function to handle MIDI program changes
--- @param seq SequenceObject Sequence to configure

--- @note The callback receives: track (0-based index), program (0-127 MIDI program number)
--- @note The callback should return an instrument to use for that program
--- @note This allows dynamic instrument switching based on MIDI program changes

--- @brief Set whether the sequence should loop
--- @param seq SequenceObject Sequence to configure
--- @param shouldLoop boolean true to loop, false to play once
--- @usage vmupro.sound.sequence.setLooping(seq, true)
--- @note This is a stub definition for IDE support only.
