## Files

### Feedback Reports

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gpt5_codex_feedback.md` | Standard GPT-5-Codex code review with severity-ranked findings |
| `gpt5_codex_max_reasoning_feedback.md` | Deep reasoning variant with extended analysis, impact maps, and validation plans |
| `gpt5_codex_max_reasoning_feedback.annotated.txt` | Line-by-line annotated version of the deep reasoning report |

### Key Findings (Summary)

The reviews identified critical issues:

1. **Sample-audio API usage** - `vmupro.sound.sample.new()` calls present crash risk on VMU Pro hardware
2. **Metadata/build configuration issues** - Level metadata files missing required imports and sound resources
3. **Audio update optimization** - Ungated `vmupro.sound.update()` calls waste CPU during silent periods
4. **Documentation drift** - README claims synth-only audio but sample API is active in code

### `gpt5_codex_annotated/`

Source files annotated with `[GPT-5-Codex]` line prefix for attribution tracking.

**Contents:**
- `app.lua.annotated.txt` - Entry wrapper
- `app_full.lua.annotated.txt` - Main game logic (436KB)
- `api__text.lua.annotated.txt` - Text rendering API
- `data__*.lua.annotated.txt` - Game data modules (items, classes, achievements, etc.)

### `gpt5_codex_max_reasoning_annotated_all/`

Source files annotated with `[GPT-5-CODEX-MAX-REASONING]` line prefix. Includes both game files and SDK example files.

**Contents:**
- All files from `gpt5_codex_annotated/` (with different model tag)
- `IS BUILD FILES__*.lua.annotated.txt` - Duplicate set with build identification prefix
- `vmupro-sdk__examples__*.lua.annotated.txt` - SDK example files (17 files)

### `tmp/`

Temporary analysis artifacts including extracted code patterns and sound file lists.

## Usage

These review artifacts are reference materials for:

1. **Tracking AI-generated analysis** - Line prefixes identify which model generated each annotation
2. **Code review reference** - Feedback reports document identified issues and recommendations
3. **Build validation** - Compare metadata files against actual resource references
