# AGENTS.md for NEW-bmp-textures

**Generated:** 2026-02-17

## Purpose

This directory contains BMP texture files for game wall tiles. The textures are used in the VMUpro SDK game engine to render wall surfaces and architectural elements. All files follow a consistent naming convention with descriptive names indicating their purpose and visual characteristics.

## Key Files

| Filename | Size | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Wall-Diamond-Tile.bmp | 65,674 bytes | Diamond-pattern wall tile texture |
| Wall-Window-Tile.bmp | 65,674 bytes | Window-themed wall tile texture |
| wall-1-tile.bmp | 65,674 bytes | Primary wall tile texture (main style) |
| wall-1-tile1.bmp | 32,906 bytes | Variant 1 of primary wall tile |
| wall-1-tile2.bmp | 32,906 bytes | Variant 2 of primary wall tile |
| wall-2-tile.bmp | 65,674 bytes | Secondary wall tile texture |
| wall-3-tile.bmp | 65,674 bytes | Tertiary wall tile texture |
| wall-4-tile.bmp | 65,674 bytes | Quaternary wall tile texture |

## Texture Notes

- Standard wall tiles (wall-1-tile through wall-4-tile) use 65,674 bytes format
- Variant tiles (wall-1-tile1, wall-1-tile2) use 32,906 bytes format
- Textures are named consistently with wall-N-tile pattern for easy identification
- Special textures (Wall-Diamond-Tile, Wall-Window-Tile) follow capitalized naming convention
