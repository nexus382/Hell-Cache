That's straightforward.\n\nWe need to write code that defines a function, say is_prime(n), which returns True if n is prime, else False. We'll handle edge cases: numbers less than 2 are not prime. We'll check divisibility from 2 to sqrt(n). We'll use efficient method: iterate i from 2 to int(n**0.5)+1. If n % i == 0, return False. Also handle even numbers quickly: if n % 2 == 0 and n > 2, return False. But simple loop is fine.\n\nWe need to include docstring: description, parameters, returns, maybe example. Also include example usage: either in a if __name__ == \"__main__\": block or just after function.\n\nThe instruction: \"Write a Python function that checks if a number is prime. Include docstring and example usage.\" So we need to produce the code.\n\nWe should output only the code? The system likely expects the code block. We'll write a clean solution.\n\nAlso note: it says \"Write a Python function\", so we just output the function definition and example usage. Probably not need to import anything.\n\nLet's write:\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a given number is prime.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if n is prime, False otherwise.\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> is_prime(2)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(15)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(17)\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example usage\n    print(is_prime(2))   # True\n    print(is_prime(15))  # False\n    print(is_prime(17))  # True\n\nThat's fine.\n\nAlternatively, we could include a simple loop from 2 to sqrt(n) inclusive, step 1.

Yes, $Dog \\neq Fish$.\n        *   So, **Carol has the Dog**.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   *Proposed Solution:*\n        *   Alice: Fish\n        *   Bob: Cat\n        *   Carol: Dog\n    *   *Check Clue 1 (Alice $\\neq$ Cat):* Correct (Fish).\n    *   *Check Clue 2 (Bob $\\neq$ Dog):* Correct (Cat).\n    *   *Check Clue 3 (Carol $\\neq$ Fish):* Correct (Dog).\n    *   *Check Clue 4 (Dog owner > Alice):* Carol has the dog. Carol is older than Alice. This makes logical sense (Carol is distinct from Alice). The clue functions primarily to exclude Alice from owning the dog, which was the pivot point for solving.\n\n6.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   Start with a clear list of the knowns.\n    *   Deduce Alice's pet first (it's the most constrained).\n    *   Deduce Bob's pet next.\n    *   Assign Carol's pet by elimination.\n    *   State the final answer clearly.\n\n    *(Self-Correction during drafting)*: Make sure to explicitly explain why Clue 4 means Alice doesn't have the dog. It's a subtle point that makes the logic solid.\n\n    *Drafting the response:*\n    - Step 1: Analyze Alice. Not Cat (Clue 1). Not Dog (Clue 4 - someone else is older than her, so she isn't the dog owner). So Alice is Fish.\n    - Step 2: Analyze Bob. Not Dog (Clue 2). Alice has Fish. So Bob is Cat.\n    - Step 3: Analyze Carol. Only Dog left. Checks out with Clue 3 (Not Fish).\n    - Final Summary.\n\n7.  **Final Polish:** Ensure the tone is helpful and logical.

It's a messenger/intermediary.\n    *   What is REST? It's a style/architecture (rules) for building these APIs.\n    *   Key concepts: Resources (data), HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), Statelessness.\n    *   Goal: Allow different software to talk to each other over the web.\n\n3.  **Drafting - Paragraph 1: The \"What\" (The Analogy):**\n    *   *Concept:* The API acts as a waiter.\n    *   *Analogy:* Restaurant.\n    *   *Roles:* Customer (Client/User), Kitchen (Server/Database), Waiter (API).\n    *   *Flow:* You don't go into the kitchen to cook; you tell the waiter what you want based on a menu.\n    *   *Drafting thought:* Start with the restaurant analogy. It's the classic one for a reason.\n\n4.  **Drafting - Paragraph 2: The \"How\" (The REST part):**\n    *   *Concept:* How the waiter communicates. Standard methods.\n    *   *Analogy:* The Menu / Ordering system.\n    *   *Key REST verbs:* GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove).\n    *   *Mapping:* \"GET a burger,\" \"DELETE the pickles.\"\n    *   *Drafting thought:* Focus on the specific actions. In a restaurant, you don't just scream \"food.\" You use a specific order format. REST provides that format (standard requests).\n\n5.  **Drafting - Paragraph 3: The \"Why\" / Real-world application:**\n    *   *Concept:* Independence and statelessness. The waiter doesn't need to know your life story, just the order.\n    *   *Analogy:* Universal adapters or, continuing the restaurant theme, a franchise.\n    *   *Real-world example:* Weather apps, logging in with Google.\n    *   *Drafting thought:* Bring it back to technology. Why do developers use this? It makes it easy for different apps (like Instagram and your phone's camera) to share information without knowing how the other is built.\n\n6.  **Review and Refine (Iterative Polishing):**\n\n    *   *Paragraph 1 (The Waiter):* \"Imagine you are at a restaurant. You (the client) want food, but you can\u2019t just walk into the kitchen (the server) and start cooking. You need a middleman. That middleman is the API (Application Programming Interface), acting like a waiter. You look at the menu to see what is available, tell the waiter your order, and the waiter takes that request to the kitchen. Once the kitchen prepares the food, the waiter brings it back to you. The API works the same way: it takes a request from an app, talks to a server, and brings back the data you asked for.\"\n\n    *   *Paragraph 2 (The Menu/REST):* \"Now, 'REST' (Representational State Transfer) is just a set of rules for how the waiter and kitchen talk to each other to make sure there is no confusion. Think of it like a standardized ordering system. In a REST system, the 'menu' items are standard actions like 'Read,' 'Add,' 'Change,' or 'Remove.' For example, when you use a weather app, the app sends a 'GET' request (like ordering from the menu) to a weather server to read the temperature. If you save a favorite city, the app sends a 'POST' request to add that city to a list. By following these strict rules, the system stays organized and efficient.\"\n\n    *   *Paragraph 3 (The Big Picture):* \"The beauty of a REST API is that it allows different programs to work together without ever needing to know how the other one is built. Going back to the restaurant, you don\u2019t need to know the chef's secret recipe, and the chef doesn\u2019t need to know who you are; you just need to agree on the order. This is why you can use your Google account to log into a completely different website, or why Spotify can show your Facebook friends what you are listening to. The API connects them instantly, like a universal translator that lets different software speak the same language.\"\n\n7.  **Final Check:**\n    *   3 paragraphs? Yes.\n    *   Simple analogies? Yes (Restaurant/Waiter/Menu).\n    *   Beginner friendly? Yes.\n\n8.  **Final Output Generation.** (This matches the drafted text above).",
            "answer": "Imagine you are sitting at a table in a restaurant. You (the client) are hungry for information, but you cannot simply walk into the kitchen (the server) to cook the food yourself. You need a middleman. In this scenario, the **API (Application Programming Interface)** is the waiter. You look at the menu to see what you can order, and you give your request to the waiter. The waiter takes that request to the kitchen, grabs the food (the data), and brings it back to your table. You never have to know how the kitchen operates; you just get the result you asked for.\n\n**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is essentially a set of strict rules that the restaurant follows to make sure service runs smoothly. It ensures that the waiter doesn't just wander around or guess what you want; instead, they use a very specific format to place orders. In the digital world, this usually involves \"verbs\" or actions. The most common ones are **GET** (like reading the menu), **POST** (placing an order), **PUT** (changing your order), and **DELETE** (canceling the order). By sticking to these standard rules, the communication between you and the kitchen stays organized and efficient.\n\nFinally, the \"menu\" in this analogy represents the specific \"endpoints\" or addresses you are allowed to visit. Just as you can\u2019t order a pizza at a sushi restaurant, you can\u2019t ask a weather API for your bank balance. The API provides a list of specific resources you can access, such as a list of users or a specific photo. When two different software programs need to talk to each other\u2014like when Spotify displays a song inside an Instagram story\u2014they use this REST API structure to trade information instantly and securely without ever breaking the system.",

Also include example usage: print(is_prime(5)) etc.\n\nWe'll produce a full answer with code block.\n\nLet's write:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check whether a given integer is a prime number.\n\n    A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive\n    divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    n : int\n        The integer to be checked.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    bool\n        True if n is prime, False otherwise.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> is_prime(5)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(4)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(1)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(0)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(-7)\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    # 2 is prime\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    # even numbers greater than 2 are not prime\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    # check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20, -5, 0]\n    for num in test_numbers:\n        print(f\"{num}: {is_prime(num)}\")\n\nThat's good.\n\nBut maybe they want just the function and docstring, not the script. But \"Include docstring and example usage.\" So we can show both. We'll output code block with function and a small example usage comment or demonstration.\n\nThus final answer.",

Let's look at both.\n\n### Method 1: Convert the Percentage to a Decimal\n\nThis is the most common and direct method.\n\n**Step 1: Convert 15% to a decimal.**\nTo convert a percentage to a decimal, you divide it by 100 (or simply move the decimal point two places to the left).\n15% = 15 / 100 = **0.15**\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the decimal by the number.**\nNow, multiply the decimal form of the percentage (0.15) by the total number (847).\n0.15 \u00d7 847 = **127.05**\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Break the Percentage into Easier Parts\n\n15% can be thought of as the sum of 10% and 5%, which are often easier to calculate mentally.\n\n**Step 1: Find 10% of 847.**\nTo find 10%, you just move the decimal point one place to the left.\n10% of 847 = **84.7**\n\n**Step 2: Find 5% of 847.**\n5% is exactly half of 10%. So, take the result from Step 1 and divide it by 2.\n5% of 847 = 84.7 / 2 = **42.35**\n\n**Step 3: Add the two parts together.**\nNow, add the 10% part and the 5% part to get 15%.\n84.7 + 42.35 = **127.05**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\n**15% of 847 is 127.05.**",

Here is a Python function to check for a prime number, complete with a docstring and example usage.\n\nThe most efficient way to check for primality for small to medium-sized numbers is to:\n1.  Handle the base cases: numbers less than 2 are not prime.\n2.  Handle the only even prime, 2, separately.\n3.  Test for factors only up to the square root of the number. If a number has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a factor smaller than it.\n4.

It explains what the function does, its arguments (`Args`), and what it returns (`Returns`). This is a standard best practice in Python.\n\n4.  **Base Cases**:\n    ```python\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    ```\n    *   The first line handles numbers that are not prime by definition (any integer less than or equal to 1).\n    *   The second line immediately identifies `2` as prime, as it's the only even prime.\n    *   The third line filters out all other even numbers (4, 6, 8, ...), which cannot be prime.\n\n5.  **The Loop for Odd Divisors**:\n    ```python\n    i = 3\n    while i <= math.sqrt(n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    ```\n    *   We start our check with `i = 3` because we've already handled 1, 2, and all other even numbers.\n    *   The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. This is a key optimization; we don't need to check for divisors larger than the square root.\n    *   The modulo operator (`%`) gives the remainder of a division. If `n % i` is `0`, it means `i` divides `n` evenly, so `n` cannot be prime.\n    *   `i += 2` makes the loop check only odd numbers (3, 5, 7, ...), further improving efficiency.\n\n6.  **Final `return True`**:\n    ```python\n    return True\n    ```\n    If the function gets to this line, it means no divisors were found in the loop. Therefore, the number `n` must be prime. The function returns `True`.",

Apply the Direct Clues**\n\nLet's use the most straightforward clues first to eliminate possibilities.\n\n*   **\"Alice doesn't have a cat.\"**\n    This means we can eliminate the \"Cat\" option for Alice.\n\n| | Cat | Dog | Fish |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Alice** | **No** | ? | ? |\n| **Bob** | ? | ? | ? |\n| **Carol** | ? | ? | ? |\n\n*   **\"Bob doesn't have a dog.\"**\n    This means we can eliminate the \"Dog\" option for Bob.\n\n| | Cat | Dog | Fish |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Alice** | **No** | ? | ? |\n| **Bob** | ? | **No** | ? |\n| **Carol** | ? | ? | ? |\n\n*   **\"Carol doesn't have a fish.\"**\n    This means we can eliminate the \"Fish\" option for Carol.\n\n| | Cat | Dog | Fish |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Alice** | **No** | ? | ? |\n| **Bob** | ? | **No** | ? |\n| **Carol** | ? | ? | **No** |\n\n### **3. Use the Process of Elimination**\n\nNow we can use the rule that each person has one and only one pet, and each pet is owned by one and only one person.\n\n*   **Look at Carol's row.** We know she doesn't have a fish. That leaves only \"Cat\" or \"Dog\".\n*   **Look at Alice's row.** We know she doesn't have a cat. That leaves only \"Dog\" or \"Fish\".\n\nLet's try a deduction:\n*   **Assume Alice has the Dog.** If Alice has the Dog, then Carol cannot have the Dog. Since Carol also can't have the fish, **Carol must have the Cat.**\n*   Now look at Bob. The only remaining pet is the Fish. So, **Bob would have the Fish.**\n\nThis gives us a potential solution:\n*   **Alice:** Dog\n*   **Bob:** Fish\n*   **Carol:** Cat\n\nLet's hold that solution and check it against the final clue.\n\n### **4. Check the Final Clue**\n\nThe last clue is: **\"The person with the dog is older than Alice.\"**\n\nLet's see what this clue tells us in our potential solution:\n*   If Alice has the dog, the clue would read: \"The person with the dog (Alice) is older than Alice.\"\n*   This is a logical contradiction. A person cannot be older than themself.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that **Alice has the dog must be wrong.**\n\n### **5. Find the Correct Solution**\n\nLet's go back to our grid of possibilities and find the only other option.\n\n| | Cat | Dog | Fish |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Alice** | **No** | ? | ? |\n| **Bob** | ? | **No** | ? |\n| **Carol** | ? | ? | **No** |\n\n*   We know Alice cannot have the Cat, and we now know she also cannot have the Dog.\n*   Therefore, by elimination, **Alice must have the Fish.**\n\nLet's update the grid with this certain fact.\n\n| | Cat | Dog | Fish |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Alice** | **No** | **No** | **Yes** |\n| **Bob** | ? | **No** | ? |\n| **Carol** | ? | ? | **No** |\n\nNow, let's see who is left for the other pets.\n*   The **Cat** can't belong to Alice or Carol (Carol doesn't have a fish, but if Carol had a cat, Bob would have the dog, which is possible... let's re-check). The Cat can't belong to Alice. It could belong to Bob or Carol.\n*   The **Dog** can't belong to Bob. It could belong to Alice or Carol.\n\nLet's use elimination again:\n*   Look at **Bob's** row. He can't have a dog. Alice already has the fish. Therefore, the only pet left for Bob is the **Cat**.\n*   Now, the only pet left is the **Dog**, and the only person left who can have it is **Carol**.\n\n### **6. Final Solution**\n\nThis gives us our final, logically sound arrangement:\n\n*   **Alice** has the **Fish**.\n*   **Bob** has the **Cat**.\n*   **Carol** has the **Dog**.\n\nLet's double-check this against all the rules:\n1.  **Alice doesn't have a cat.** (Correct, she has a Fish)\n2.  **Bob doesn't have a dog.** (Correct, he has a Cat)\n3.  **Carol doesn't have a fish.** (Correct, she has a Dog)\n4.  **The person with the dog is older than Alice.** (Correct, Carol has the dog, and the clue states she is older than Alice. This doesn't create a contradiction.)\n\nAll conditions are met.",

            "answer": "Imagine you're at a restaurant, and you are the customer. You (the \"client\") don't go into the kitchen to cook your own meal or grab ingredients yourself. Instead, you give your order to a waiter, who acts as a messenger. This waiter takes your request to the kitchen (the \"server\"), and once the food is ready, the waiter brings it back to you. In the world of computers, a REST API works just like this waiter. It's a set of rules that lets different applications (like a website on your computer and a database on a server) talk to each other in a simple, orderly way.\n\nNow, let's look at the menu. When you order, you don't just shout \"food!\" You be specific. You might say, \"I would like the 'spaghetti' dish.\" This is like using an **endpoint** in an API, which is a specific address on the server (like `/api/menu/spaghetti`) that tells the server exactly what you want. You also tell the waiter how you want your order handled. Do you want to see the menu (**GET**), add a new dish to the menu (**POST**), change an existing order (**PUT**), or cancel one (**DELETE**)? These are called HTTP methods, and they are the different ways you can ask the server to do something.\n\nFinally, think about the waiter bringing your food back to the table. They don't just hand you a pile of raw ingredients; they bring you a nicely prepared plate that you can understand and eat. The server does the same thing. When it receives your request, it sends back a response, often in a format called JSON, which is like a neatly organized list or a simple recipe. Your application (the customer) can then easily read this response and use the information. This entire process of sending a clear request and getting a simple response, all without the client needing to know the messy details of the kitchen, is the core idea of a RESTful API.",
