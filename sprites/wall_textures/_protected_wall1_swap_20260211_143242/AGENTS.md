# Backup: wall1_swap (2026-02-11)

<!-- Parent: ../AGENTS.md -->

## Overview

This directory contains backup wall texture files created on **2026-02-11 at 14:32:42**. These files were preserved before a texture swap operation.

## Contents

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `wall-1-tile.png` | 11,338 bytes | Original wall-1 tile texture |
| `wall-1-tile-table-1-128.png` | 11,338 bytes | Wall-1 tile variant for table-1 (128px) |

## Purpose

This is a **protected backup directory** created during a wall texture swap operation. The `_protected_` prefix and timestamp indicate these files should not be modified or deleted without explicit action.

## Related

- Parent directory: `../` (active wall textures)
- Backup date: 2026-02-11
- Backup time: 14:32:42

## Notes

- Both files are identical in size (11,338 bytes), suggesting they may be copies of the same source texture
- Files retain their original timestamps from 2026-02-10 (creation date)
